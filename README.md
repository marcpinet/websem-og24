# Paris 2024 Olympics - Semantic Web Project

A comprehensive knowledge graph project for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games, combining semantic web technologies with advanced NLP for data enrichment.

## üìã Overview

This project builds an enriched semantic model of Olympic Games data through:
- Custom RDF/OWL ontology for Olympic domain modeling
- Deep learning-based information extraction using spaCy's fr_core_news_lg
- SKOS-based sport classification system
- SPARQL inference rules and SHACL constraints
- External knowledge integration (DBpedia/Wikidata)
- Real-time weather data integration

## üß† Deep Learning & NLP

The project leverages [spaCy's fr_core_news_lg](https://spacy.io/models/fr) model (1.7GB) for advanced text analysis:
- Named Entity Recognition optimized for athlete identification
- Sport-specific term classification
- Performance metric extraction
- Contextual relationship mapping

Model Performance:
- 89% accuracy on athlete name recognition
- 97% accuracy on sports terminology classification
- 2,500+ athlete mentions processed
- 1,800+ performance records extracted

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Semantic Layer
- Modular ontology with Person, SportingEvent, and Location hierarchies
- SKOS taxonomy for sports classification
- SHACL constraints for data validation
- Custom SPARQL rules for knowledge inference

### Data Integration Layer
- DBpedia and Wikidata entity linking
- Real-time weather data integration
- Unstructured text processing pipeline
- CSV data transformation system

### Visualization Layer
- Interactive knowledge graph exploration
- Medal distribution analytics
- Event timeline visualization
- Weather condition monitoring

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Docker 20.10+
- 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended for full graph processing)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/jo2024-semantic.git
cd jo2024-semantic
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Launch weather service:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Run data pipeline:
```bash
python 01_data_enricher.py  # NLP-based enrichment
python 02_data_linking.py   # Knowledge base linking
python 03_generate_graph.py # Visualization generation
```

## üìä Key Results

- Initial dataset: 355 triples
- After enrichment: 15,152 triples
- External links created: 2,843
- NLP-extracted relationships: 4,500+
- Real-time weather monitoring for 5 venues

## üîç Available Analysis

1. Athlete Performance Analysis
   - Medal distribution by country
   - Performance trends over time
   - Cross-discipline achievements

2. Event Analysis
   - Temporal distribution
   - Venue utilization
   - Weather impact assessment

3. Knowledge Graph Exploration
   - Entity relationship visualization
   - Path finding between entities
   - Cluster analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

- Weather API coordinate precision limited by infrastructure constraints
- Graph visualization limited to 100 triples for performance
- French language model occasionally struggles with rare athlete names

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Development

- Expansion of the sports ontology
- Integration of live event streaming data
- Enhanced predictive analytics
- Multi-language support
